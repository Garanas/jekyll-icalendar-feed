# Jekyll posts in your personal agenda

This gem provides a generator for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn posts into a RFC 5545 compliant `ics` file using the [icalendar](https://github.com/icalendar/icalendar) library. This allows you to generate a feed that you can subscribe to with your calendar application. You can view compatible posts straight in your agenda.
